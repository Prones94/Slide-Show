# JavaScript Tutorial: Slideshow

This repository contains all of the sample files to get started and the completed project and source code for reference.

The goal of this tutorial is to create a JavaScript slideshow. The slideshow will be similar to what you see on web banners with images that cycle sliding right to left. You'll build the whole things from scratch. 

The code used will also be portable, it will be able to be used in any web site without modification.
